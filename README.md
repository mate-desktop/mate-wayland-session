# üöÄ MATE Wayland Session

Wayland session using Wayfire for the MATE desktop

## üì¶ Building MATE-WAYLAND-SESSION

You need Wayfire installed to run this session, as the startup script and configuration file are Wayfire-specific. Autotools or Meson will install the files in the correct places.

## üî• Wayfire Firedecor Plugin Recommended

It is recommended to install the Firedecor Wayfire plugin. This allows the use of a window decorator theme similar to the Menta Marco theme. If unavailable, the session will still work. The initial setup will not attempt to set a MATE-specific window decoration theme but will do everything else the same way.

## üìù Notes on Install Directories for Firedecor Theme

To use the Menta style window control buttons instead of Firedecor's default buttons, ensure the data directory used in installing mate-wayland-session matches the one used by Firedecor. Here are some scenarios:

1. **Firedecor installed to `/usr`, mate-wayland-session installed to `/usr`**: Menta window buttons on first run.
   - Common when installed from distro packages.

2. **Firedecor installed to `/usr/local`, mate-wayland-session installed to `/usr/local`**: Menta window buttons on first run.
   - Common for local builds installed to `/usr/local`.

3. **Firedecor installed to `/usr`, mate-wayland-session installed to `/usr/local`**: Firedecor default window buttons used on first run.
   - To show Menta buttons, copy or symlink buttons from `/usr/local/firedecor/button-styles/mate/` to `/usr/firedecor/button-styles/mate/`.

4. **Firedecor installed to `/usr/local`, mate-wayland-session installed to `/usr`**: Firedecor default window buttons used on first run.
   - Copy or symlink buttons from `/usr/firedecor/button-styles/mate/` to `/usr/local/firedecor/button-styles/mate/`.

## üìã Details of MATE-WAYLAND-SESSION

This is a simple and experimental MATE session using Wayfire, a Wayland compositor reimplementing much of the look and feel of Compiz.

- **Display Managers**: Tested and known to work under SDDM, should work with any Wayland-supporting display manager.
- **Session Launcher**: A script (`mate-wayland-components.sh`) launches MATE programs inside Wayfire. This session cannot run simultaneously with an X11 session using dbus on another TTY.
- **Startup Configuration**: Edit `~/.config/wayfire.ini` to add `mate-wayland-components.sh` and disable the default Wayfire shell.
- **Components**: Starts MATE components like Caja and Mate-panel without interfering with other parts of the user's Wayfire configuration.

### üõ† Configuration

- **GSettings**: GNOME, not MATE, gsettings preferences apply for fonts and icon themes under Wayland. For XWayland apps, MATE settings are applied.
- **GTK Options**: Many options selectable in X11 are hardcoded in Wayland. For example, headerbars on dialogs clash with the MATE UI and can be fixed by installing [GTK 3 with gtk3-classic patches](https://github.com/lah7/gtk3-classic).

### üîß Setting Themes and Fonts

Use `dconf-editor` to reset the GTK theme, icon theme, and fonts in `org/gnome/desktop/interface`. Apply preferences under both MATE and GNOME to theme Wayland and XWayland apps consistently.

### üìë GSettings Override

A gsettings override file sets the MATE icon theme and Menta GTK theme, and turns off overlay scrolling on a new or default install.

### üé® Window Decoration

Install the "Firedecor" plugin for a window decorator theme similar to the Menta Marco theme in X11. If not installed, Wayfire's default SSD decoration theme is used.

- **Future Development**: Another decorator under development can read Marco themes from [wf-external-decoration](https://github.com/marcof-nikogo/wf-external-decoration).
- **Default to SSD**: Server-side decoration is preferred due to issues with CSD on MATE apps.

### ‚ùå No XSettings Manager

Wayland compositors control more of the session than X11 window managers. Wayfire in Wayland handles much of what Marco, mate-session-manager, and mate-settings-daemon do in X11.

## üìÇ Wayfire Configuration Manager (WCM) Recommended

Wayfire Configuration Manager provides a GUI similar to CCSM for Compiz, allowing control over many options managed by the compositor in a Wayland session.
